EOML-Server
===========
    W.I.P: Just slowly adding stuff.

Very simple and easy to understand/use directory service for music libraries.
It's just an exercise for me to learn about threading and sockets, so it is not
meant for actual intensive deployment.

Installation
------------
**Required Packages:**

    Perl::IO::Socket, perl::File::Find::Rule, Perl::Threads, Perl::FindBin

**Instructions**

    Make sure your music library is acurately sorted and follows typical
    Artist-Album-Tracks layout.
    Install the required packages either through package manager or cpanm.
    Open firewall on the selected ports in config file.
    Run the EOMlServer.pl file.

**Making your own configurations:** Edit the config file included.
